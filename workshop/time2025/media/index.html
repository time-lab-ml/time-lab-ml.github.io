            <p class="news-content">
            TIME 2025 hosted a thought-provoking panel discussion on ‘Bridging Innovation and Responsibility in Web Technologies’, moderated by Dr. Syed M. Shamsul Islam and co-chaired by Dr. Zakir Hossain. The session featured expert panelists: A/Prof. Wei Liu (UWA), A/Prof. Rafiqul Islam (CSU), Dr. Lei Wang (Griffith University), and Dr. Basem Suleiman (UNSW). The discussion delved into critical topics at the intersection of AI ethics, human-in-the-loop systems, and responsible innovation in web technologies. <br>

            The panelists explored the future of AI and web technologies, emphasizing the need for ethical guidelines and transparency in developing AI systems. They highlighted the human-centric approach required to ensure AI solutions serve the greater good, addressing challenges like bias, fairness, and accountability. <br>

            One of the key takeaways was the urgent need for the integration of human-in-the-loop mechanisms to enhance the decision-making capabilities of AI systems while safeguarding ethical standards. The discussion also highlighted the importance of collaborative frameworks between technologists, policymakers, and end-users to address the broader implications of AI deployment in real-world scenarios. <br>

            The panel concluded with a call to action for ongoing dialogue and research on how to balance technological innovation with social responsibility, ensuring that web technologies contribute positively to society while mitigating potential risks.
